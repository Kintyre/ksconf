  ### WORST CASE:  Move this into it's own ksconf-precommit repo, that intalls 'ksconf' and 'lxml'....   ;-(  Probably easier than making pre-commit specific tags/branches or some junk like that...
  # Apparently additional_dependencies only works on pre-commit-config not in hooks?!
  #additional_dependencies: lxml  (unclear if this is supported for all languages)
  # I wonder what would happen if I set lxml as a build requirement instead of an install requirement.   Since 'pip install .' would likely install both?!?!
